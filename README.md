# Florui

Native Rust interfaces, with the expressiveness of CSS.

Florui is an early-stage UI framework exploring a familiar way to build native applications: composable Rust components, JSX-inspired markup, and CSS stylesheets.

Its goal is to reproduce the layout and visual behavior of the Web through a native rendering engine. Chromium serves as a reference for comparison tests; it is not embedded in the native application.

## Status

Florui is in early development. The repository currently provides a minimal native preview host, CSS fixture reload, and development diagnostics. It is not yet a usable application framework.

The preview renders a single element and reads a limited `body { background-color: ... }` fixture. It does not implement general CSS parsing, cascade, layout, or the planned component API. The bootstrap renderer uses CPU pixels; the production GPU pipeline is still planned.

## Intended authoring experience

Components own their styles and compose through ordinary Rust imports. The proposed declarative macro is `view!`.

**Design example — not implemented yet:**

```rust
use florui::prelude::*;

stylesheet!("./button.css");

#[component]
pub fn Button(label: String) -> Element {
    view! {
        <button class="button">{label}</button>
    }
}
```

```css
.button {
    padding: 10px 16px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 8px;
    background: #42734f;
    color: white;
    font: inherit;
}

.button:hover {
    background: #345c3e;
}
```

The planned build integration collects component stylesheets automatically, so application entry points do not need to register every component's CSS.

## Run the development preview

Install Rust through rustup and the native build tools for your platform. The repository pins Rust 1.94.0 in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Initial development and CI focus on Windows; other platforms are not yet validated.

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo run -p florui-cli -- dev
```

Edit the color in [`fixtures/dev/app.css`](fixtures/dev/app.css) and save to update the preview. Reload failures are reported while the preview retains its last valid revision.

To use a different fixture:

```sh
cargo run -p florui-cli -- dev --fixture path/to/app.css
```

The fixture must follow the same limited format. A desktop session is required to open the preview window.

Only `dev` is currently implemented. The CLI also declares `new`, `test`, `compare`, and `build`, but these commands are placeholders and return an error.

## Direction

- **CSS fidelity:** implement style, layout, text, and painting with explicit compatibility coverage and reproducible visual comparisons.
- **Composition:** user-defined components, typed props, hooks, context, and owned async work.
- **Development tools first:** CSS hot reload, an inspector, source-linked diagnostics, and profiling to support development of the engine itself.
- **Complete interaction:** text editing, keyboard navigation, accessibility, and overlays alongside visual rendering.
- **Shared authoring for Web:** a planned DOM backend using Rust/WebAssembly, separate from the native rendering pipeline.

Pixel-perfect output is a testing goal for controlled fixtures, not a current claim of complete CSS support or identical rendering across all platforms. Performance claims will require published measurements.

## Development checks

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo test --workspace --doc
```

Keep changes focused and distinguish implemented behavior from proposals. Bug reports are most useful with reproduction steps, environment details, and a minimal fixture. Visual reports should include the expected and actual output.
