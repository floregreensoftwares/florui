//! An isolated feasibility experiment, separate from
//! `florui_platform::appearance`'s own committed contract: does a real
//! `wgpu` surface actually composite alpha with the desktop on this
//! machine, where `softbuffer` (see `appearance_probe`'s own doc)
//! provably cannot? This does not change what `appearance_probe` reports
//! and nothing here is wired into `florui_platform::desktop` — it exists
//! to gather real evidence before any of that.
//!
//! `wgpu` supporting alpha in principle doesn't mean this machine's
//! actual adapter/surface/compositor combination does —
//! [`SurfaceCapabilities::alpha_modes`] is queried and printed for real,
//! not assumed, and picking `CompositeAlphaMode::PostMultiplied`/
//! `PreMultiplied` when the list only ever offers `Opaque` would just
//! silently fall back to opaque presentation, the same trap
//! `appearance_probe`'s own `Attempted`-vs-verified distinction exists to
//! avoid.
//!
//! # A real, verified finding: real Windows transparency through `wgpu`, with an exact recipe
//!
//! This module's own first draft concluded `wgpu`'s standard surface
//! couldn't get real alpha compositing on Windows at all, having only
//! tried `wgpu`'s *default* DX12 configuration. That conclusion was
//! wrong, caught by re-checking against `wgpu`'s own source rather than
//! trusting the first negative result: `wgpu` 29.0.4 has a *second*,
//! non-default DX12 presentation path,
//! [`Dx12SwapchainKind::DxgiFromVisual`] (the default,
//! `DxgiFromHwnd`, is documented — in `wgpu` itself — as not supporting
//! transparency at all; `DxgiFromVisual` is the one documented as
//! supporting it, via a DirectComposition visual `wgpu` creates
//! automatically). Getting a real transparent, alpha-composited window
//! actually working end to end — confirmed by a human looking at the
//! real desktop showing through, at both partial and full transparency,
//! not just an API call returning success — took every one of these,
//! together, on real discrete-GPU Windows hardware:
//!
//! - `Backends::DX12` specifically (`Backends::VULKAN` reports
//!   `alpha_modes: [Opaque]` and nothing else on the same machine, a
//!   finding that still stands).
//! - `backend_options.dx12.presentation_system =
//!   Dx12SwapchainKind::DxgiFromVisual`, not `wgpu`'s own default.
//! - **Both** `WindowAttributes::with_transparent(true)` **and** the
//!   separate, Windows-specific
//!   `WindowAttributesExtWindows::with_no_redirection_bitmap(true)`.
//!   Without the second one, `Surface::configure` still succeeds and
//!   nothing errors anywhere — the window just paints solid color with
//!   no desktop showing through, because the window's own default
//!   redirection bitmap stays opaque behind whatever DirectComposition
//!   draws. This exact silent failure mode is what made this module's
//!   first (wrong) conclusion look confirmed.
//! - `CompositeAlphaMode::PreMultiplied`, not `PostMultiplied` — both are
//!   listed in `alpha_modes`, but selecting `PostMultiplied` makes
//!   `Surface::configure` panic with a `wgpu` validation error
//!   ("Invalid surface") in this exact DX12 DirectComposition path, a
//!   real `wgpu` 29.0.4 limitation distinct from anything about Windows
//!   or this crate. Clear colors have to actually be premultiplied to
//!   match (`(r*a, g*a, b*a, a)`), which [`ClearState::clear_color`]
//!   does.
//!
//! With all of that, `TransparentSurface` genuinely is achievable on
//! Windows through `wgpu` — this crate's earlier, broader claim that
//! switching backends "wouldn't deliver it either" was itself wrong, not
//! just under-evidenced. Metal (macOS) and Vulkan-on-Wayland/X11
//! (Linux) each need their own from-scratch verification along these
//! same lines — nothing here transfers across platforms by assumption,
//! per [`Dx12SwapchainKind`] being exactly the kind of
//! platform-specific, non-obvious detail a *different* backend's own
//! "obvious" default configuration could just as easily be hiding.
//!
//! `cargo run --example gpu_transparency_probe -p florui-platform`
//!
//! Press Space to cycle the whole window through three states — opaque
//! red, 50%-alpha green, and fully transparent (alpha `0.0`) — and
//! actually look at each one against whatever's behind this window on
//! the real desktop. Also resize the window and move it to a
//! different-DPI display if one is available, watching stdout for what
//! this probe observes.
//!
//! `wgpu` picks a default backend (Vulkan, on most real Windows
//! machines) unless told otherwise — set `FLORUI_GPU_BACKEND` to
//! `vulkan`, `dx12`, or `gl` to force a specific one; the working recipe
//! above only applies to `dx12`. `WGPU_DX12_PRESENTATION_SYSTEM=hwnd`
//! (a real `wgpu` env var this probe already respects) reproduces the
//! original, non-transparent default for a side-by-side comparison.
