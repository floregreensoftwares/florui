//! [`run`]: pairs [`UiRuntime`] with a real `winit` window, a `softbuffer`
//! surface, and an event loop, so a caller doesn't have to write its own
//! desktop event loop just to see a component tree running. [`run_windows`]
//! is the same thing generalized to any number of windows at once, each
//! independently titled/styled/iconed — [`run`]/[`run_with_options`]/
//! [`run_with_css_reload`]/[`run_with_css_reload_and_options`] are thin
//! wrappers over it for the common one-window case.
//!
//! HiDPI-aware: layout runs against the window's *logical* size (via
//! [`crate::dpi`]), matching `florui_style`'s CSS-style `width`/`height`;
//! the committed boxes are then scaled back up by the window's own scale
//! factor before painting, so the canvas renders at full physical device
//! resolution rather than blurrily upscaling a logical-resolution one.
//! Cursor positions (physical, from `winit`) are converted the other way
//! before hit-testing against that same logical layout.
