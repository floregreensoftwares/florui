//! Real GPU-backed window presentation for [`crate::desktop`]'s
//! `DesktopHost`, preferred over `softbuffer` whenever a real adapter
//! comes up — `softbuffer` stays the deliberate CPU fallback when it
//! doesn't, not a path this crate is dropping. Painting itself is
//! unchanged either way: [`florui_paint::paint_to_buffer`] still
//! rasterizes on the CPU exactly as before; only *how the resulting
//! pixels reach the screen* differs. Uploading a CPU-painted buffer to
//! the GPU every frame has a real cost this module doesn't eliminate —
//! it only buys real desktop-compositor alpha, not faster painting; a
//! true GPU-rendered paint pipeline is a separate, later migration.
//!
//! # Two separate questions, not one
//!
//! "Can this host render through the GPU at all?" and "can it also
//! present a genuinely transparent window?" are independent — failing
//! the second must not force falling back on the first. That's
//! [`PresentationCapability`]'s own three states, decided once per
//! window and never silently downgraded later:
//!
//! - [`PresentationCapability::GpuTransparent`]: a real adapter/device
//!   came up *and* the surface negotiated genuine per-pixel alpha
//!   compositing — the exact `Backends::DX12` +
//!   `Dx12SwapchainKind::DxgiFromVisual` +
//!   `with_no_redirection_bitmap(true)` + `CompositeAlphaMode::PreMultiplied`
//!   recipe the `gpu_transparency_probe` example (see its own doc)
//!   confirmed live, human-verified against the real desktop, not just
//!   `Surface::configure` returning success.
//! - [`PresentationCapability::GpuOpaque`]: a real adapter/device came
//!   up, but no real alpha compositing mode did (or wasn't attempted) —
//!   still GPU-presented, just opaque. This is not a failure case:
//!   GPU rendering with an opaque window is strictly better than
//!   falling all the way back to the CPU path over a decorative
//!   capability alone.
//! - [`PresentationCapability::Cpu`]: no usable GPU adapter came up at
//!   all — the same `softbuffer` presentation this crate already used
//!   everywhere, unchanged, and still opaque-only (see
//!   `crate::appearance`'s own doc for why `softbuffer` itself can
//!   never do per-pixel alpha).
//!
//! No dedicated GPU is required for either GPU-backed capability — an
//! integrated GPU with the right adapter/driver features is enough, and
//! "DirectX 12 is installed" alone doesn't guarantee that; the real
//! adapter/driver combination decides, which is exactly why this is
//! probed live against a real window rather than assumed from the OS
//! version.
//!
//! # What's validated here, and what isn't yet
//!
//! Run live end to end through `crate::desktop::DesktopHost` (the
//! `counter` example, `cargo run --example counter -p florui-example-app`),
//! not just this module's own probe: a real window came up through
//! [`PresentationCapability::GpuTransparent`] on this machine, survived a
//! live resize (816×639 to 1200×800, reconfigured and repainted correctly
//! with no distortion or crash), correctly dispatched a real click through
//! `DesktopHost`'s own hit-testing and `Signal` update (the counter's
//! value and its derived `x2` both advanced, proving layout, paint, and
//! presentation all stayed in sync through this path), and survived a
//! real minimize/restore cycle (process stayed responsive throughout,
//! resumed rendering correctly afterward, no repeated
//! `"could not present the frame"` errors). Painted content itself was
//! opaque throughout that run (the example's own `canvas_color`); the
//! presentation layer's real alpha capability is proven, but no example
//! has yet passed a non-opaque `canvas_color` through `DesktopHost` to
//! confirm an actually see-through *application* window end to end — the
//! next real thing to verify, not yet done.
//!
//! A lost/reset GPU device is handled defensively —
//! [`GpuPresenter::present`] treats anything other than a successful
//! texture acquisition as "skip this frame," not a panic — but this
//! crate does not yet exercise an actual induced device-loss (e.g. a
//! driver reset) as a real test; that remains an open, tracked gap, not
//! a silent assumption. Memory footprint was not measured against an
//! automated budget; color/alpha fidelity was checked by eye against
//! real screenshots (this module's own probe and the `counter` run
//! above), not an automated reference image.
