//! [`use_resource`]: component-owned async work with typed idle/pending/
//! ready/failed states — see async-and-errors.md.
//!
//! Every fetch is tied to an internal generation counter: starting a new
//! one (because the key changed, or [`ResourceHandle::retry`] was called)
//! both best-effort aborts whatever was still in flight *and* bumps the
//! generation, so even a completion that slips past the abort is rejected
//! at commit time — a slow old response can never overwrite a newer
//! result. Owner disposal (the component unmounting) cancels the same way,
//! reusing [`crate::use_effect`]'s existing "cleanup on unmount" contract
//! rather than adding a second lifecycle mechanism.
