//! Persistent local component state: [`use_signal`], [`use_memo`],
//! [`use_context`], [`use_ref`], [`use_effect`], [`use_child_scope`]/
//! [`use_child_scope_keyed`], and the [`Scope`] that gives them somewhere
//! stable to live across repeated renders of the same tree.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Not built yet: automatic dependency tracking for `use_memo`/`use_effect`
//! (deps are compared by equality, not inferred). One `Scope` has one
//! flat, call-ordered slot list for its *positional* hooks, so every
//! order-sensitive hook call in the tree it renders must run in the same
//! order and count every time — `use_context` is the exception (a
//! provided value is looked up by type, not call position), and so is
//! [`use_child_scope_keyed`] (a child looked up by [`Key`] instead of
//! position, so a list can reorder without losing each item's own state).
//! A host learns about a [`Signal::set`] anywhere under its root either by
//! polling [`DirtyFlag::get`] or, better, registering a
//! [`DirtyFlag::on_mark`] callback to hear about it the instant it
//! happens — [`batch`] coalesces that notification across every write in
//! one synchronous unit of work (an event handler), rather than firing it
//! once per [`Signal::set`]. `Signal::get`'s read-after-write contract is
//! always synchronous, batched or not: it returns whatever the most
//! recent `set` stored, immediately — `batch` defers *notifying a host*,
//! never the write or a subsequent read of it.
