//! [`loading_boundary`]: coordinates an explicit set of required
//! [`ResourceHandle`]s' readiness against a fallback — see
//! loading-boundaries.md. This is coordination over the existing resource
//! system, not a second executor: it never starts, cancels, or retries a
//! read itself, only decides which of two subtrees to mount based on
//! state those reads already expose.
//!
//! Not addressed here (tracked gaps, not oversights): marking the pending
//! region busy for assistive technology and restoring focus predictably
//! on fallback replacement both need the accessibility/focus systems a
//! later stage builds; optional minimum-display-time policies need a
//! shared controllable clock this crate doesn't have yet.
