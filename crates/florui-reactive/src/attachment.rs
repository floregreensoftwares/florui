//! [`use_attachment`]: associates reusable, typed setup/cleanup behavior
//! with whatever capability handle this call site owns, without inserting
//! a wrapper — see attachments.md. This crate has no notion of a mounted
//! native element yet (refs and layout snapshots arrive in a later
//! stage), so `handle` is whatever typed capability the caller already
//! has; the first real capability (a size observer) plugs into this same
//! lifecycle once that exists, rather than needing a new one.
//!
//! Not addressed here (tracked gaps, not oversights): coalescing
//! duplicate geometry notifications, diagnosing observer feedback loops,
//! and arbitrating exclusive capabilities like pointer capture all need a
//! real capability to arbitrate over — none exists yet. A setup that
//! kicks off async work and later tries to touch a disposed capability
//! isn't guarded against generically here; a real capability's own handle
//! should carry that guard when one exists.
