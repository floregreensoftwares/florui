//! Keyed measurement and scroll-anchor contracts for a future virtualized
//! collection — see virtualization.md's own "design identities and
//! measurement hooks early; deliver after layout, scrolling, and focus
//! are functional." This module is exactly that early design: real,
//! tested types a virtualized list will build on, not a virtualized list
//! itself. Mounting a bounded visible range with overscan, recycling
//! render resources, and the actual scrolling/focus/accessibility policy
//! all remain later work.
//!
//! [`Key`] is reused as-is for item identity — virtualization.md's own
//! "item identity is a data key, never a recycled row index" is already
//! exactly what [`use_child_scope_keyed`](crate::use_child_scope_keyed)
//! enforces for keyed children; a virtualized list is only a stricter
//! consumer of the same identity, not a reason for a second one.
