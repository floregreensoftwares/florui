//! [`Binding`]: a typed, read/write value exchange for editable component
//! values, kept separate from ordinary read-only props — see
//! slots-and-bindings.md's "Explicit bindings." Receiving a plain `T`
//! never grants mutation rights; only a `Binding<T>` does, and even then
//! the owner decides whether to actually accept a requested update.
//!
//! This type covers the *logical* read/write contract only: what the
//! owner's value currently is, and how a requested change reaches the
//! owner. It does not cover *visual* reconciliation of an editable
//! control — see [`Self::get`]'s doc for exactly what "the owner rejected
//! an update" guarantees and what it leaves to whatever control eventually
//! reads a `Binding`, since that's a real, currently open question rather
//! than something a `Binding` resolves on its own.
//!
//! Not addressed here (tracked gaps, not oversights): a real input
//! control's own editing buffer (distinct from its committed value),
//! commit timing, IME composition, and selection preservation through a
//! rejected edit all need an actual text-input widget, which doesn't
//! exist in this engine yet. This module is the primitive that widget
//! will read and write through, proven here with plain values rather than
//! a real control.

/// A read/write exchange for one value: [`Self::get`] reads the owner's
/// current value, [`Self::request_update`] asks the owner to change it.
/// The owner remains the source of truth and may reject a request outright
/// (a value that fails validation, for example).
///
/// A `Binding` is a **snapshot**, captured once at construction — `get`
/// does not re-read the owner live, so a `Binding` held past the render
/// (or event handler) that created it keeps returning that original
/// value forever, not whatever the owner holds by the time you call
/// `get` later. A *fresh* `Binding`, derived again from the owner, is
/// what reflects a change — which is exactly how a rejected
/// `request_update` "reconciles": the next fresh `Binding` simply never
/// picked up the rejected value in the first place, the same way it
/// wouldn't pick up any other change nobody accepted. That's the whole
/// logical-value guarantee this type makes.
///
/// It says nothing about what a real editable control does with that
/// guarantee. If nothing the owner does on rejection causes a re-render
/// (no accepted `Signal::set` happened, so nothing is marked dirty), no
/// fresh `Binding` gets derived at all — and even where one is, a native
/// widget that already echoed the rejected keystroke into its own visible
/// text needs to actively resync its displayed content to match, or the
/// rejection stays invisible. Neither half of that exists yet: there's no
/// widget, and nothing here forces a re-render on rejection. A real
/// control built on this type will need to solve both explicitly.
