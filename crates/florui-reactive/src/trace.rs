//! [`UpdateTrace`]: which component a reactive write came from, without
//! recording the value written — see reactivity.md's "Expose state update
//! provenance to the development trace without unnecessarily recording
//! user-entered values" and async-and-errors.md's "Verify traces identify
//! the initiating component without logging sensitive payloads."
//!
//! `#[component]` wraps every component's body in [`with_component`]
//! automatically, so a plain [`crate::Signal::set`] anywhere in ordinary
//! component code is attributed with no extra effort from whoever wrote
//! it. A write that commits well after the render that started it — an
//! async resource's eventual completion — needs [`with_component`] called
//! again around that later commit; [`crate::use_resource`] does this
//! itself, using whichever component was active when the fetch started.
