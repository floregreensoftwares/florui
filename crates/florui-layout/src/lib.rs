//! Turns a [`florui_style::Arena`] plus its computed styles into geometry,
//! via [Taffy](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy) — validated against
//! Taffy 0.14's actual current API rather than assumed from memory.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Block and flex layout — a node's own `display` selects which algorithm
//! lays out *its children*; a node's own box within its *parent* additionally
//! depends on `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink`/`flex-basis`/`align-self` when that
//! parent is a flex container, regardless of the node's own `display`. Grid
//! is not implemented yet, even though Taffy itself already supports it —
//! `florui-style` has no `grid-*` properties to translate from.
//!
//! `width`/`height` are content-box, explicitly, since that is real CSS's
//! actual default (before any reset stylesheet opts into border-box) —
//! Taffy's own default is border-box and silently relying on that would
//! make an explicit size shrink to fit its own padding instead of the
//! padding adding to it. `florui-style` has no `box-sizing` property to
//! override this yet.
//!
//! A leaf node (no element children) with its own direct text is measured
//! via [`florui_text`] — real shaping, not a guess — and that intrinsic
//! size is used wherever the node's own `width`/`height` don't already
//! settle it. A leaf with no text still lays out at `0x0` when it has no
//! explicit size, since there is nothing to measure it from.
//!
//! Real inline formatting context, for a container whose children mix
//! text with `display: inline`/`inline-block` elements
//! (`<p>Hello <span>world</span>!</p>`) — Taffy itself has no inline
//! display mode at all, so this is a genuinely separate algorithm built on
//! [`florui_text::Font::shape_inline`]'s real multi-style text wrapping
//! and in-flow boxes, not a translation onto an existing Taffy algorithm
//! the way flex was. See [`needs_inline_layout`]'s own doc for the exact,
//! honest bound: one level of mixed inline content (an `Inline`/
//! `InlineBlock` child must itself be a leaf), every element child must be
//! inline-level (a block/flex sibling mixed in falls back to the older,
//! coarser block-only behavior rather than partially-correct output), and
//! a plain `Inline` child does not get its own [`BoxLayout`] yet — only
//! its text, mixed into its container's one inline-formatting-context box;
//! only `InlineBlock` children (real `display: inline-block`, e.g. a
//! `<button>`) get an exact one, sized to their own content and positioned
//! within the flow.
//!
//! Taffy positions are relative to the parent's content box, matching
//! Taffy's own convention; see [`absolute_position`] to accumulate them
//! into a position relative to the layout root.
//!
//! A very deep tree (hundreds of nested levels) no longer *crashes* —
//! `compute_layout` grows its own stack via `stacker` before running
//! Taffy's real layout algorithms, which recurse once per tree depth
//! internally and would otherwise overflow the default stack well under
//! 1,000 levels.
