//! Decodes a window icon (SVG or PNG) into plain RGBA pixels, and embeds
//! an already-decoded icon into a generated Rust source file at build
//! time so a shipped binary never depends on the source asset being
//! present on disk. No `winit` (or any windowing) dependency — converting
//! [`RawIcon`] into a real platform icon type belongs to whichever crate
//! actually creates windows.
//!
//! [`RawIcon`] itself has no dependencies; decoding and embedding live
//! behind the `decode` feature (default-on) so a consumer that only needs
//! the type (e.g. the runtime side of an already build-time-embedded
//! icon) doesn't have to link `resvg`/`image`.
