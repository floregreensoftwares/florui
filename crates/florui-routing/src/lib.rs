//! Typed native routing: an app defines its own route enum implementing
//! [`Routable`], mounts it with [`provide_router`], and reads/navigates
//! it via [`use_router`]/[`use_route`]/[`route_outlet`]. Deliberately
//! platform-independent -- this crate depends only on `florui` and
//! `florui-reactive`, never `florui-platform`, so it stays usable from a
//! future Web host too. A native app bridges its own deep-link events
//! (e.g. `florui_platform`'s activation events) into navigation itself,
//! via [`Router::apply_external`] -- see that method's own doc.
//!
//! Leaving a route disposes its whole subtree by default (every signal,
//! effect, and nested outlet it owns) -- there is no keep-alive cache;
//! an app that needs one builds it itself on top of [`route_outlet`].
//! Scroll and focus restoration are similarly the app's own job: this
//! crate has no window or viewport handle, so it only stores and hands
//! back a [`florui_reactive::ScrollAnchor`] per history entry (see
//! [`Router::set_current_scroll_anchor`]) and reports when a navigation
//! committed (see [`use_route_transition`]) -- it never scrolls or
//! focuses anything itself.
