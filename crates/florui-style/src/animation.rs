//! Persistent state real `transition`/`@keyframes` animation needs across
//! [`crate::cascade::compute`] calls, which is otherwise a pure function of
//! its arguments (see [`crate::stylo`]'s own module doc): Stylo's real
//! animation engine (`style::animation`) samples an in-progress transition
//! or animation against the *previous* cascade's computed value and an
//! [`style::animation::ElementAnimationSet`] it expects to find again next
//! frame — both of which need somewhere to live between one `compute()`
//! call and the next.
//!
//! [`Arena`](crate::tree::Arena) rebuilds from scratch every call with no
//! stable per-element identity (a `NodeId` is just preorder position), so
//! this also owns the identity scheme animation state is actually keyed
//! by: each element's `tag` and position among same-tag siblings, chained
//! up to the document root. Deliberately *not* class-sensitive — a class
//! toggle or a `:hover` match changing is the most common way real CSS
//! ever triggers a transition in the first place, so identity has to
//! survive exactly that kind of change to be useful. Two elements in one
//! tree can never collide (their paths diverge at the first differing
//! ordinal), and the common case — a render that doesn't reorder or
//! add/remove same-tag siblings around this one — keeps the same identity
//! call over call, so its animation continues rather than restarting. A
//! same-tag element swapped in at the same position (a conditional
//! branch, a keyless list reorder) can still be mistaken for the outgoing
//! one and inherit its in-flight animation — the same honest ambiguity
//! any keyless positional matching has, real CSS included.
