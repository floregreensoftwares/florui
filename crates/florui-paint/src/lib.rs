//! Paints a styled, laid-out `florui_style::Arena` into pixels — the
//! "painting" stage at the end of the pipeline (components → elements →
//! style → boxes/layout → text → **painting**).
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Flat background-color rectangles, solid borders, and hard-edged
//! box-shadows, painted in real paint order (see [`paint_order`]): a
//! node before its children, and within one node's own children,
//! document order — except a flex or grid child with an explicit
//! `z-index` reorders among its own siblings the same way real CSS
//! does, the only case florui can express `z-index` for yet (there is
//! no `position` property, so nothing here establishes a positioned
//! element's own stacking context). An overlap always resolves to
//! whichever box paints later. A leaf's own text (see
//! [`florui_style::Arena::text_content`]) paints inside its padding
//! box: glyph outlines come from [`florui_text::Font::shape`] and are
//! rasterized with [skrifa](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontations)'s
//! outline extractor feeding a
//! [tiny-skia](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/tiny-skia) path, the same
//! rasterizer backgrounds/borders/shadows use — one painting backend,
//! not several. A node with `opacity` below `1.0`, a `transform`, a
//! `filter`, or any combination paints itself and its whole subtree into
//! an offscreen buffer first, composited back as one group (see
//! [`paint_group`]) — real CSS's own group-opacity semantics (not a
//! per-primitive alpha multiply) and its own "transform moves the whole
//! rendered result, clip included" rule for transforms, both falling out
//! of the same offscreen-buffer mechanism for free: the buffer already
//! holds the group's content at its normal, untransformed position, so
//! compositing it back with a real matrix instead of the identity one
//! moves everything — background, border, already-clipped descendants —
//! as a single unit, pivoting around [`ComputedStyle::transform_origin`].
//! See [`resolve_transform`] for the supported `transform` subset and its
//! own matrix composition, and [`apply_filters`] for the documented
//! `filter` subset (`blur`/`brightness`/`contrast`/`saturate`), applied to
//! that same buffer before it's composited — real CSS's own
//! filter-then-composite order. `backdrop-filter` (same subset) works the
//! other way: [`apply_backdrop_filter`] samples what's already painted
//! behind a node, filters it, and writes it back before that node's own
//! background/border/content paint on top.
//!
//! `box-shadow`'s `blur-radius` is painted too, via a real Gaussian blur
//! — see [`blur`]'s own module doc: tiny-skia 0.11 (this crate's whole
//! rasterizer) has no blur or mask-filter primitive of its own, so this
//! crate rasterizes the shadow's own shape into a scratch alpha buffer,
//! blurs *that* by hand, and composites the result back onto the canvas
//! pixel by pixel — the one place in this crate that blends manually
//! instead of going through a `tiny_skia::Paint` fill (`filter: blur()`
//! reuses the same hand-rolled Gaussian, run over the group's own already-
//! rasterized pixels instead of a shape rasterized just for it). A node
//! whose `overflow` clips content (see [`clip_for_children`]) restricts
//! its own descendants — never its own border/background — to its
//! padding box; nested clips intersect. There is no border-radius yet —
//! `florui_style` has no property for it.
