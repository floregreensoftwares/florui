//! Reference-comparison harness: loads a fixture pairing an HTML/CSS
//! reference with Florui's own minimal render path, drives Chromium to
//! capture the reference, and compares pixels and geometry between the two.
//!
//! Development/test tooling only — never a dependency of a public Florui
//! runtime crate.
